# VOICE-CONTROLLED-DRONE-ESP32-TEACHABLE-MACHINE
This project integrates ESP32 with Teachable Machine for a voice-controlled drone. The system supports dual-mode operation (voice and manual) and provides real-time responsiveness using WebSocket communication.
## Description:
"Voice-controlled drone project integrating ESP32 for hardware control and a voice recognition model trained on Teachable Machine. The ESP32 code is available in the Voice_controlled_code directory. For connecting the Teachable Machine HTML interface with ESP32, refer to the esp32-teachable-machine-led-websocket repository. Replace the my_model folder in that repository with the folder containing your trained voice recognition model from Teachable Machine."
